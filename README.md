History Simulation with warring empires

This is an old hobby project. Originally created in July 2019. It is a small GUI application where one
can run history simulations. On a created continent, empires will rise and try to
battle each other. The simulation features
- Tile fertility and food distribution
- Population and army growth
- Wars and rebellions

Uploaded in 2023 and checked to work with Python 3.11. No code changes made. 

The simulation freeze somewhere around the year 1000, so there is probably some bug or a memory leak.

## Running
- Install the requirements
- Run the file ``main.py``pip
